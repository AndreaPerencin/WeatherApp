WeatherApp

A simple terminal-based weather forecast application written in Python. It fetches real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API (https://open-meteo.com).

The project contais two files:
 - main.py: Python source code
 - cities.csv: This file contains a list of Irish cities and towns along with their latitude and longitude coordinates.

To run the app on Linux, just move to the project folder and run: python3 main.py 
On MS Windows, run: python main.py

The app allows the user to:
 - View the daily forecast for the next week
 - View the hourly forecast for the next 48 hours
 - Add a new city to the list
 - Delete a city from the list
 - View the full list of cities in the CSV file
